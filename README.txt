1.	Register your application/project in Google API console.

Note: This link will redirect you to a new Google API console. However, I would suggest that you use the old Google API console.

2.	Create a new project by choosing Create option from the dropdown menu located at top left.

3.	Next step is to enable Analytic API from the Service API panel.

4.	Next create project credentials. Make sure you choose the Service Account. It will also ask you to download the private key file. Doenload the file and store somewhere safe on to your web server.

6.	Next create a new analytic account if you don't have one.

7.	Create a new super user and add the email address we just created in Google console API. Make this user as a Super Administrator.

8.	Next create a new file name it index.php in your web root. Paste the code I have provided in index.php. Don't forget to upload Analytic API library. As you can see at the top I have  imported two files.
